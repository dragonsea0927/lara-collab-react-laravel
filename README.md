LaraCollab, developed with Laravel and React, serves as a project management tool. The primary idea behind this initiative is to provide developers or development companies with a free platform to efficiently manage clients, projects, log time, and generate invoices. You may wonder, 'Why another tool when there are already feature-rich options available for free?' Yes, that's a valid point. However, my aim is to offer a project management tool specifically tailored for Laravel developers, giving them option to integrate and customize features according to their unique workflows.

## Features

- User roles (e.g., client, manager, developer, designer) with customizable permissions.
- Management of client companies.
- Manage client users that have access to company tasks.
- Project management with user access control.
- Task groups within projects (e.g., Todo, In progress, QA, Done, Deployed).
- Task can have a assignee, due date, custom labels, time estimation (add manually or use timer), attachments, subscribers, and comments.
- Task filters for efficient organization.
- Real-time notifications and task updates via web sockets.
- Mention functionality in task descriptions and comments.
- Personalized "My Tasks" page for each user.
- Activity page for projects or selected ones.
- Invoice generation from billable tasks with logged time.
- Print or download invoices directly from the platform.
- Dashboard offering project progress, overdue tasks, recently assigned tasks, and recent comments.
- Additional reports for daily logged time per user and total logged time.
- Dark mode support for user preference.

## Tech stack

[Laravel](https://laravel.com) for backend, [React](https://react.dev) for frontend and [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com) for "glueing" them together. For the frontend React UI components, the awesome [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) library was used.

## Setup

### Project

1. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/vstruhar/lara-collab.git`
2. Cd into the project
3. Install npm dependencies with `npm install`
4. Copy the `.env` file with `cp .env.example .env`
5. Generate an app encryption key with `php artisan key:generate`
6. Create an empty database for the application
7. In the `.env` file, add database credentials to allow Laravel to connect to the database (variables prefixed with `DB_`)
8. Migrate the database with `php artisan migrate --seed`

#### Development

9. You will be asked if you want to seed development data, for testing or development enter `yes`.
10. Install composer dependencies with `composer install`
11. Run `npm run dev`

> NOTE: [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail#introduction) was used for development, so if you want you can use that.

#### Production

9. You will be asked if you want to seed development data, for production enter `no`.
10. Run `composer install --no-dev` to install project dependencies.
11. Run `php artisan optimize` to optimize Laravel for production.
12. Run `php artisan storage:link` to create symbolic link for storage in public directory.
13. Setup [task scheduler](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/scheduling#running-the-scheduler) by adding this to cron (to edit cron run `crontab -e`).
    `* * * * * cd /path-to-your-project && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1`
14. Emails, notifications and events are queueable. If you want to enable queues then you will have to set `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database` in `.env`. And then run [queue worker](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#running-the-queue-worker) with [supervisor](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/queues#supervisor-configuration) using this command `php artisan queue:work --queue=default,email`.
15. Setup email by updating variables in `.env` that have `MAIL_` prefix.
16. Finally build frontend with `npm run build`.

### Admin user

New admin user will be created after running migrations with seed.

email: `admin@mail.com`

password: `password`

### Web sockets

You may use [Pusher](https://pusher.com) for web sockets, since number of free messages should be enough for the use case. Or you can use [open source alternatives](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/broadcasting#open-source-alternatives).

To use Pusher, sign up, then create a project and copy paste app keys to `.env` (variables with `PUSHER_` prefix).

### Social login (Google)

1. Setup "OAuth consent screen" on Google Console ([link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent)).
2. Create "OAuth Client ID", select Web application when asked for type ([link](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)).
3. Use generated "Client ID" and "Client secret" in the `.env` (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`).
